# üîê Steam Depot Manifests Explained

## What Are Depot Manifests?

Steam stores encrypted manifest files in:
```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\depots\
```

Format: `{depot_id}_{manifest_id}.manifest`

Example: `3716601_3930318588611247096.manifest`
- **Depot ID**: `3716601`
- **Manifest ID**: `3930318588611247096`

## What's Inside?

These files contain:
- File lists for the game
- Chunk information
- Download metadata
- Encrypted with depot keys

## How to Use This App

### 1. Find Your Manifests

Navigate to your Steam depots folder:
```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\depots\
```

You'll see files like:
- `228980_1234567890123456789.manifest` (Steamworks Common Redistributables)
- `730_9876543210987654321.manifest` (CS:GO)
- etc.

### 2. Get Depot Keys

You need decryption keys for depots. You can get them from:
- **SteamDB**: https://steamdb.info/depot/{depot_id}/
- **DepotDownloader**: When downloading depots
- **Steam Console**: Using depot_decrypt commands

### 3. Upload to Manager

1. Click "Upload Manifest"
2. Fill in:
   - **App ID**: The game's App ID (e.g., `730` for CS:GO)
   - **Game Name**: Full game name
   - **Depot ID**: From the filename (e.g., `3716601`)
   - **Manifest ID**: The long number (e.g., `3930318588611247096`)
   - **Depot Key** (in notes): The decryption key if you have it
3. Upload the `.manifest` file

### 4. Share & Download

Others can:
- Download your manifest files
- Use them with DepotDownloader
- Restore specific game versions
- Archive old builds

## Example Workflow

### Dumping Manifests

Using **DepotDownloader**:
```bash
DepotDownloader -app 730 -depot 731 -manifest 3930318588611247096
```

This downloads the specific version and saves the manifest.

### Using Manifests

With manifest ID and depot key:
```bash
DepotDownloader -app 730 -depot 731 -manifest 3930318588611247096 -username YOUR_USERNAME
