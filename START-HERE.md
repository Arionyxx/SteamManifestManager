You should see the Steam Manifest Manager interface.

Try uploading a manifest:
1. Click "üì§ Upload Manifest" button
2. Fill in the form (example: App ID: `730`, Game Name: `CS:GO`)
3. Select a `.acf` file from your Steam folder
4. Click Upload!

## Where to Find Steam Manifests?

Steam saves manifests as `.acf` files:

- **Windows**: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\`
- **Mac**: `~/Library/Application Support/Steam/steamapps/`
- **Linux**: `~/.steam/steam/steamapps/`

Look for files like `appmanifest_730.acf` (730 is CS:GO's App ID)

## Connecting Beehive Studio

1. Open Beehive Studio
2. New Connection with these settings:
   - Host: `localhost`
   - Port: `5432`
   - Database: `steam_manifests`
   - User: `postgres`
   - Password: `postgres`

---

## Problems?

### Docker not working?
- Make sure Docker Desktop is running (check system tray/menu bar)
- See [DOCKER-SETUP.md](DOCKER-SETUP.md) for detailed help

### Port already in use?
```bash
# Stop existing PostgreSQL
docker-compose down

# Or if you have local PostgreSQL running:
# Windows: Stop PostgreSQL service
# Mac: brew services stop postgresql
# Linux: sudo systemctl stop postgresql
```

### Database won't connect?
Check your `.env` file - the password should be `postgres`
