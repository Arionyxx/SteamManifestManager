## Where to Find Steam Depot Manifests?

Steam stores depot manifest files in:

- **Windows**: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\depots\`
- **Mac**: `~/Library/Application Support/Steam/depots/`
- **Linux**: `~/.steam/steam/depots/`

Look for files like:
- `3716601_3930318588611247096.manifest`
- `730_1234567890123456789.manifest`

Format: `{depot_id}_{manifest_id}.manifest`

**Important:** You'll also need depot decryption keys to use these manifests with tools like DepotDownloader!

See [MANIFEST-INFO.md](MANIFEST-INFO.md) for detailed information.

## Problems?

### Docker not working?
- Make sure Docker Desktop is running (check system tray/menu bar)
- See [DOCKER-SETUP.md](DOCKER-SETUP.md) for detailed help

### Port already in use?
```bash
# Stop existing PostgreSQL
docker-compose down

# Or if you have local PostgreSQL running:
# Windows: Stop PostgreSQL service
# Mac: brew services stop postgresql
# Linux: sudo systemctl stop postgresql
```

### Database won't connect?
Check your `.env` file - the password should be `postgres`
