## 🎯 Our Recommendation

### Use Firebase 🔥 Because:

1. **Your friend has Pro plan** - waste not to use it!
2. **Better architecture** - files separate from database
3. **Less maintenance** - Firebase handles everything
4. **Better performance** - Global CDN, real-time sync
5. **Professional features** - Monitoring, analytics, etc.
6. **Future-proof** - Scales automatically

### But Free Stack Works Great If:

1. You prefer PostgreSQL (traditional SQL)
2. You want full control
3. You don't want to learn Firebase
4. Current code already works
5. You want to avoid vendor lock-in
